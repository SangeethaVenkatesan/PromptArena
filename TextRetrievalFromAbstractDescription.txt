Main prompt:
Let's write abstract descriptions of sentences. Example:

Sentence: Pilate's role in the events leading to the crucifixion lent themselves to melodrama, even tragedy, and Pilate often has a role
in medieval mystery plays. 

Description: A description of a historical religious figure's involvement in a significant event and its later portrayal in art.

Note: Descriptions can differ in the level of abstraction, granularity and the part of the sentence they focus on. Some descriptions
need to be abstract, while others should be concrete and detailed.

For the following sentence, write up 5 good and stand-alone, independent descriptions and 5 bad descriptions (which may be related,
but are clearly wrong). Output a json file with keys 'good', 'bad'.

Sentence: {sentence}

Start your answer with a curly bracket.
